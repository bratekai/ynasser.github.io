In February 2016, <a href="www.anitachowdry.com">Anita Chowdry</a> was invited to the university to present at a 
<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/events/events/bridges-lecture-harmonograph">Bridges lecture</a>,
alongside John Baez (from <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/">The n-Category Cafe</a>).

</p>
About 10 students were invited to help her in building two harmonographs for the talk, and I was lucky enough to
be one of them!

Here's a video of us building the harmonographs, with the working products at the end: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRQ7y3Ul8g
