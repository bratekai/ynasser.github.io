<h1>
    <center>Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) (WIP)</center>
</h1>

<center>
(A lot of this is just rephrasing the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-guide#simplified-payment-verification-spv"><i>Bitcoin Developer Guide</i></a> [1] and Satoshi's original paper [2].)
</center>
<br>
<br>
Note: I originally chose this as a topic because I misheard a lecturer say "simplified proof verification" and got excited thinking it was something related to pure math. Turns out it's not :(
<br>
<br>
<p>When validating the blockchain, there are currently two main options to choose from: the full node ("trustless") model and using SPV clients. In full node verification, you validate the most recent block all the way back to the genesis block. It's basically impossible to fool a client using full node verification, because you'd need to give them a longer chain than the one they have (and because of how Bitcoin operates, they will have the longest one by definition). Also, it's not computationally possible to construct a longer fake chain and pass it off to them.
</p>
<p>
Although full node validation is very secure, it's more resource intensive, both computational and storage-wise. At the time of writing this (8/15/2016), the blockchain's size is <a href="https://blockchain.info/charts/blocks-size">roughly 79 GB</a>. SPV, the alternative approach, involves a client only downloading all the block headers in the beginning, and then "requesting transactions from full nodes as needed."[1] Each block header is 80 bytes, and since a block is generated roughly every 10 minutes (and there 525600 minutes in a year), this works out to $\frac{525600}{10}*80$ bytes $\approx 4.2$ mb.
</p>
<p>
When processing or validating a transaction, the SPV client can request the merkle branch for a given merkle root to check that the transaction is actually in a block. Then the SPV client can "look to block depth as a proxy for transaction validity and security." [1]
</p>
<p>
While more efficient, the SPV approach is not without its flaws. Although you can't really trick the client into thinking a transaction is in a block when it's actually not, you can still <b>lie by omission</b> and say that a block isn't there when it actually is--a sort of denial of service attack. To get around this, "care must be taken to ensure the client is not cut off from honest nodes" and to query multiple different nodes for the same information for the sake of cross-checking.[1]
