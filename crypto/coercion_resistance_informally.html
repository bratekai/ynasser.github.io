<h2>
    <center>Understanding Coercion Resistance (Informally) (WIP)</center>
</h2>
<center>
  (This is partially a summary of the opening of section 9.4 of Clark's thesis <a href="http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~clark/theses/phd_electronic.pdf"><i>Democracy Enhancing Technologies: Towards Deployable and Incoercible E2E Elections</i></a>.)

<b>Introduction</b>

<p>Suppose a voter $v$ has been selected for coercion. The voter has intention $I_v$ (it doesn't matter what, whether it's to
abstain from voting, vote for a specific candidate, destroy their ballot, and so on).
</p>
<p>We will be defining coercion resistance through a Shoup-style game with coin flips. If we get heads, the voter completely 
complies with the coercer. "More formally, if the voter is an interactive Turing machine (ITM), the coercer learns her internal
 state and she only forwards messages to and from the coercer." The strategy of purely obeying is called a "dummy strategy". </p>
<p>If the coin is tails, the voter will do her best to "deceive the coercer". Notice that the voter is specifically trying to
deceive the coercer, and not ignoring them or something else.</p>
