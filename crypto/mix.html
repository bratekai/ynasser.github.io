<h1>
    <center>The Basics of Mix Networks (WIP)</center>
</h1>

<center>
(This is a summary of Chaum's 1981 paper <a href="http://www.csl.mtu.edu/cs6461/www/Reading/08/Chaum-ACMCOMM81.pdf"><i>Untraceable Electronic Mail, Return Addresses, and Digital Pseudonyms</i></a>.)

<b>Introduction</b>
<br>
<br>
There is a well-known problem in cryptography called the <i>traffic analysis problem</i>. We want to be able to, in some kind of network, keep confidential:
<ol>
    <li> who converses with whom, and </li>
    <li> when they each converse.</li>
</ol>
... and we want to do this without putting too much (or ideally <i>any</i>) trust into some central authority. We are going to walk through a solution involving nothing more than basic public key cryptography.
<br>
<br>
<b>Notation and overview of public key cryptography</b>
<br>
<br>
<i>This will just be a very quick overview. If you aren't familiar with the basics of public key cryptography, I suggest reading <a href="">this</a>.</i>
<br>
<p>Each user in the system is responsible for generating a public key $K_{pub}$ (which is shared with everyone else) and a private key $K_{priv}$ (which is kept secret). Recall that given a message $M$, we have $k_{priv}(k_{pub}(M))=M=K_{pub}(K_{priv}(M))$.
<br>
<br>
Suppose you encrypt some message $X$ $K_{pub}(X)$ and someone intercepts your message and makes a guess as to the encrypted message $Y$. They can simply check $K_{pub}(X)=K_{pub}(Y)$ to see if their guess is correct. Thus, messages are padded with random bits to prevent adversaries from guessing the contents of your message. PUT OTHER STUFF HERE.
</p>
<b>Assumptions</b>
<ol>
    <li>No one can decrypt messages or create forgeries without $K_{priv}$.</li>
    <li>Everyone can see where the messages on the network came from, where they're going, and their "representation". Also, anyone can add in extra messages, remove existing messages, or modify them.</li>
</ol>
<b>Mail System</b>
<br>
<p>
The cryptosystem also includes a computer called a mix which is responsible for processing all mail before it's delivered. The mix is responsible for trying to hide relationship between messages it receives and messages it outputs.<!-- fix this -->
</p>
<p>
Suppose you want to send a message $M$ to another user at address $A$ whose public key is $K_{a}$. You must first pass this message to the mixer (whose public key is $K_1$), who will forward it to destination $A$ on your behalf. Let $\rightarrow$ denote how messages are input and output from a mix. Everything on the left of $\rightarrow$ is input, and everything on the right is output. Thus, we have: $$K_1(R_1,K_a(R_0,M),A) \rightarrow K_a(R_0,M).$$
</p>

<p>
TODO: processing happens in batches ... <br>

As the mix's purpose is to disassociate input with output, there are several technicalities we need to consider:
<ol>
    <li>Disassociating the input and output orders. It won't do if the mix simples follows the "first in, first out" principle. This is fixed by "outputting uniformly sized items in lexicographically ordered batches." (page 85) TODO </li><!-- this makes no sense! also -->
    <li>What if inputs are repeated? Then it's not hard to figure out which output corresponded to it. Thus, the mix must take care to not process redundant copies.<!-- Why isn't it enough to just pad it more and add more randomness?--></li>
</ol>
