Goal: 25 minutes with 5 minutes of questions?
Topics: an introduction to tiling theory and Islamic star patterns

Some things I will have to cover:
1. What is a tiling? A periodic tiling?
2. How do we name/describe tilings? Are there special tilings? Mention Frieze and Wallpaper groups ... classifying symmetry in the plane!
3. How do we make tilings? Computers or straightedge & compass. Show some examples. Also show Kepler's weird tilings.
4. What is an Islamic star pattern?
5. How did they used to make Islamic star patterns?
    -> We don't really know, but we can make educated guesses based on the geometry we knew they had access to back then.
    -> Examples of different kinds of star patterns from different regions. There are some regional styles, but there 
    is not a comprehensive way of determing where most Islamic star patterns originate. There is lots of work to be done
    in this area of historical mathematics.
6. How do we make Islamic star patterns now?
    -> Hankin's PIC ... cover regular polygons first
    -> Mention that different tilings will produce the same result if PIC is applied to them
    -> This hints at some kind of ... underlying structure?
    -> Touch on Parquet deformations which happen as a result of this.
    -> Go back and cover what happens in you aren't using regular polygons. 

How do I give a math talk which is not all definitions?
